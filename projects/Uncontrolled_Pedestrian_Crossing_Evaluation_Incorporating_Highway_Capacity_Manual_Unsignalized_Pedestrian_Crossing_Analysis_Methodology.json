    "purpose": "This report outlines a multi-step procedure for evaluating uncontrolled pedestrian crossings, focusing on both safety and delay, incorporating the Highway Capacity Manual's delay methodology. The evaluation considers various factors such as field data, safety history, sight distance, and treatment options, ranging from signage and marking to high-level treatments.",
