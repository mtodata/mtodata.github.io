    "purpose": "This report investigates the impact of the Variable Speed Limit (VSL) system on safety in a high-crash area on I-94 westbound through downtown Minneapolis. Using video data, traffic measurements, and machine vision sensors, the study applied a before-and-after analysis to assess crash rates and shockwave activity, aiming to enhance safety by reducing speed variations between upstream and downstream traffic.",
