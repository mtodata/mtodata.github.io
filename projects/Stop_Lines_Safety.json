    "purpose": "This project examined the long-term impact of stop lines on intersection safety and driver behavior through crash data analysis and video observation at 16 intersections. The study found that stop lines did not significantly influence safety or behavior, with factors like speed limits and sight distance being more critical for improving intersection safety and compliance.",
