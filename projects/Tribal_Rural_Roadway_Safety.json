    "purpose": "This report summarizes a study of pedestrian crossing behaviors at high-risk intersections on four Anishinaabe reservations in northern Minnesota, where pedestrian-vehicle interactions ranged from 9% to 54%. In collaboration with Tribal and transportation agencies, site-specific safety countermeasures were proposed, with some already being implemented and plans to expand the effort to other reservations.",
